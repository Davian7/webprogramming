# Project Four

I want you to build a fullstack application that does something you've thought up, or copies an existing app's functionality (build a "lite" version of facebook, airbnb, )

The only requirements are this:

- It uses a front end Single-Page Application framework like React.
- It has a server (express or something else for xtra credit) that serves the front end and exposes APi endpoints.
- it uses a postgres database to persist data (Use elephantSQL).
- You email me by 11/26 with your proposed app idea.
